# Varis
Varis stands for Vetra's auto rice & install script and it does just about everthing it promises
Basically its just a file which contains sudo apt install x y z 

So basically you have two files
Varis
and 
VarisMinimal

Varis - goes like hell, installs everything I need
VarisMinimal - installs only the barebones shit
